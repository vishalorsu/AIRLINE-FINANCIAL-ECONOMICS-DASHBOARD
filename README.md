# AIRLINE-FINANCIAL-ECONOMICS-DASHBOARD
Project Overview
This project, developed as part of the DAEN 690 Capstone at George Mason University, focuses on building an Airline Financial Economics Dashboard in collaboration with the GMU Center for Air Transportation Systems Research (CATSR). The dashboard integrates financial data from the U.S. Department of Transportationâ€™s Form 41 with stock price data for selected airlines to analyze financial trends and performance.

Automated Data Updates: Regular updates of Form 41 airline financial data and stock price information.
Visualizations: Clear tables and charts to display financial metrics, stock price trends, and key operational indicators like load factor, revenue passenger-miles, and fuel efficiency.
Trend Analysis: Utilizes machine learning and statistical models to identify correlations between airline performance metrics and stock prices.
Data Sources
Form 41 Data: Comprehensive financial and operational information from U.S. airlines.
Stock Price Data: Includes stock data for publicly traded airlines.
Project Structure
